	<h1>You Jump</h1>
	<p>
		You back up to get a running start, but right before you get to the edge you trip on a small rock. Maybe bring a flashlight next time. As you're falling you reach out and grab a lever that is protruding from one of the sides of the hole, you pull the lever down with the force of your fall. A door opens. What do you do?
